# Hey ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Nils Mertens**, a passionate programmer and computer science student at **AP University of Applied Sciences**. I specialize in **fullstack web development**, and my main tech stack includes:

* **Express**
* **MongoDB**
* **EJS**

I enjoy working on both personal and professional projects, and I also have a strong interest in **system administration** and **networking**. In my free time, I maintain a **home server**, contribute to **open source** projects, and explore new technologies.

I'm particularly interested in building websites or features that are typically locked behind paywalls and making them **free to use**, or enhancing them with **extra functionality**.

Outside of coding, I'm also a dedicated **gamer** and general **tech enthusiast**.
